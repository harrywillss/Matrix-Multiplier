Created a simple matrix multiplier to help me to understand how it works.

You can define your own matrices in the `main()` function.

This was just a little side thing and did not come in handy as the exam didn't even contain matrix multiplication...

Oh well, at least now I know how to find the dot product of matrices I guess????
